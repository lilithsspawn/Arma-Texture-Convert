# Arma-Texture-Convert
Various templates for Shadermap 4 to Convert Arma 2 / Arma 3 / DayZ textures to Arma Reforger equivalents

Usage:
Open the template with Shadermap 4 and load the required textures (_CO, _SMDI and _NOHQ) into the slots in the far left of the project grid. The program will now do it's magic, which can - depending on your hardware - take some time. After textures are done rendering, save the textures on the far right as the appropriate _BCR and _NMO textures.
